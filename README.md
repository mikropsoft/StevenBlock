Hey there, digital explorer! üëã Ready to reclaim your online experience? Say hello to **StevenBlock**, your new best friend in the fight against pesky ads and sneaky malware. Let's dive into how this little powerhouse can transform your digital life!

## **üöÄ What Makes StevenBlock Your Digital Superhero?**

-   **üõë Ad Annihilator**: Wave goodbye to annoying pop-ups, intrusive video ads, and clingy banners. **StevenBlock** makes them vanish.

-   **üì± App Ad Assassin**: Tired of ads crashing your app party? **StevenBlock** kicks them to the curb, letting you enjoy your apps in uninterrupted peace.

-   **üéØ Customizable Protection**: You are in control! During installation, choose from four different blocklists, from light to aggressive, to perfectly match your needs.

-   **üîã Battery Friendly**: **StevenBlock** is a lean, mean, blocking machine. It's **not an app** that runs in the background. It's a system-level module, meaning it does its job silently without draining your battery.

-   **üõ°Ô∏è Broad Root Support**: Whether you're using **Magisk**, **KernelSU**, or **APatch**, **StevenBlock** integrates seamlessly. We've got your back, no matter your root solution.

-   **üí¨ Conversation Keeper**: Don't worry, we know you need to stay connected. **StevenBlock** plays nice with WhatsApp, Telegram, and LinkedIn, keeping your social and professional lifelines intact.

-   **üîÑ Effortless Updates**: Keeping **StevenBlock** fighting fit is a breeze. Your root manager handles updates, so you're always rocking the latest and greatest protection with just a few taps.

## **üéØ Choose Your Shield: Customizable Blocklists**

**StevenBlock** now puts the power in your hands. During installation, you'll be prompted to select the hosts file that best suits your browsing style.

-   **StevenBlack (Main)**: The classic, balanced blocklist. A great starting point for most users, based on the original **StevenBlack** hosts.
-   **1Hosts Lite (Light)**: A lighter touch for minimal blocking, focusing on the most intrusive ads while maintaining high compatibility.
-   **1Hosts Pro (Balanced)**: A comprehensive and well-rounded list for everyday use, blocking a wide range of ads, trackers, and malware.
-   **1Hosts Xtra (Aggressive)**: For the power user who wants maximum blocking. This list is more aggressive and may require some manual whitelisting for certain sites or services.

## **üìä The Numbers Game: How We Protect You**

> [!WARNING]
> Brace yourself: Depending on the list you choose, **StevenBlock** acts as a bouncer for your device, blocking between **100,000 to 500,000+** troublemakers (read: malware, ad, and spyware domains). And just like a top-tier security team, our blocklists are constantly updated to keep the riffraff out.

## **üß† Knowledge is Power: F.A.Q. Time!**

> [!TIP]
> **‚ùî: What's this "hosts file" and where is it?**
>
> Think of the hosts file as your device's bouncer list. It lives in `/system/etc` and tells your device which connections to block before they even start.

> [!TIP]
> **‚ùî: How does StevenBlock actually work?**
>
> It's a master of misdirection. When an app or website tries to connect to a blocked domain, **StevenBlock** redirects that request to a digital dead end (0.0.0.0). By merging multiple trusted sources into one powerful hosts file, we ensure comprehensive protection without slowing you down.

> [!TIP]
> **‚ùî: How can I see what's being blocked?**
>
> Curiosity is a great thing! Head over to Google Play or F-Droid and search for a "hosts manager" or "hosts editor" app. These tools let you view and even customize the list of blocked domains.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Let's Get This Party Started: Installation Guide**

Ready to level up your digital defense? It's as easy as 1-2-3-4:

1.  **Grab & Install**: Open your root manager (**Magisk**, **KernelSU**, or **APatch**), head to the Modules section, tap the 'Install from storage' button, and select the **StevenBlock** module zip.
2.  **Choose Your Shield**: An interactive menu will appear during installation. Use your **Volume Up** key to navigate through the blocklist options and **Volume Down** to confirm your selection.
3.  **Quick Reboot**: Give your device a quick restart to activate **StevenBlock**'s shields.
4.  **Enjoy the Peace**: Welcome to your new, cleaner, and faster digital world!

## **üîî Hot Off the Press: Updates & Pro Tips**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're already using a root solution like **Magisk**, **KernelSU**, or **APatch**, you **do not** need any other "systemless hosts" modules. **StevenBlock** handles everything. For best results, avoid using it alongside **AdAway** to prevent conflicts.

> [!INFO]
> **What's NOT Blocked By Default?**
> **StevenBlock** focuses on ads, trackers, and malware. It does **not** include blocklists for pornography or gambling websites. If you need those, join our Telegram group! The community often shares custom lists you can use.

> [!NOTE]
> While we're pros at blocking domains, some ads served directly by browsers (like on YouTube's website) might still sneak through. We're powerful, but not quite magicians!

> [!TIP]
> We're always evolving! Expect fresh updates 1-2 times a week. Star us on GitHub to stay in the loop. Most root solutions will notify you of updates, but checking our GitHub is always a good idea.
