## 📊 The Numbers Game: Domains We've Got Your Back On

> [!WARNING]
> Brace yourself: StevenBlock is like a bouncer for your device, keeping a watchful eye on 100,000 to 500,000 troublemakers (read: malware, ad, and spyware domains). And just like your favorite club's security, we're always updating our list to keep the riffraff out.

## 🧠 Knowledge is Power: F.A.Q. Time!

> [!TIP]
> **❔: What's this "hosts file" I keep hearing about, and where's it hiding?**
> 
> Think of the hosts file as your device's very own bouncer list. It's tucked away in `/system/etc`, deciding who gets in and who gets the boot when your device tries to connect to websites.

> [!TIP]
> **❔: How does StevenBlock work its magic?**
> 
> It's like a master of misdirection. When your device tries to chat up a blocked website, StevenBlock sends it to a digital dead end instead. We've recently beefed up our skills, merging multiple files into one lean, mean, blocking machine that can handle over 100,000 to 200,000 bad actors.

> [!TIP]
> **❔: I'm curious about what's getting blocked. How can I take a peek?**
> 
> Curiosity is healthy! Hit up Google Play or F-Droid and search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor". These nifty tools let you browse and tweak your blocked domain list like a pro.

## 🔔 Hot Off the Press: Updates & Pro Tips

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Already rocking a root solution? No need for extra systemless hosts modules. Just install StevenBlock and you're golden. Oh, and it's best not to mix this with AdAway - they don't play well together.

> [!NOTE]
> Just a heads up: While we're pros at blocking domains, browser-based ads might still sneak through. We're good, but we're not magicians!

> [!TIP]
> We're always evolving! Expect fresh updates 1-2 times a week. Star us on GitHub to stay in the loop. Most root solutions will auto-update, but it never hurts to check our GitHub for the latest and greatest.
